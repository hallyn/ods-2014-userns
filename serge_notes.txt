Containers have been around awhile

	no "container" in kernel
	userspace fiction built on set of kernel features

	new features added over time

		mount ns ~ 2000
		nsproxy, utsns, pidns in 2006
		cgroups - 2007

	first userns patch in 2007
		separate accounting only
		no isolation
	full user namespaces - most recent feature - Dec 2012

	meanwhile, what did we do?
